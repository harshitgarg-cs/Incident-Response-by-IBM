# Incident Response by IBM & Clicked

## Overview
This repository contains all the deliverables and documentation created as part of the Incident Response and Review Mini Sprint hosted by Clicked. During this sprint, I took on the role of a Cybersecurity Analyst, focusing on the application of the NIST Incident Response Process Framework to manage and mitigate cybersecurity threats.

The project involved simulating a real-world incident response scenario for Maven Clinic, where my team and I were responsible for identifying a security threat, formulating a response plan, and compiling a comprehensive post-incident review.

## Project Goals
1. Detect, analyze, and respond to a simulated cybersecurity incident using the NIST Incident Response Process Framework.
2. Collaborate with team members to propose effective containment, eradication, and recovery strategies.
3. Compile and present findings in a detailed post-incident report.
4. Communicate key takeaways and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Deliverables
1. **Incident Response Plan:** A detailed report outlining the steps taken to detect, contain, and mitigate the identified threat.

2. **Containment and Eradication Strategy:** A comprehensive plan for isolating affected systems and removing malicious components from the environment.

3. **Post-Incident Review Report:** A final report summarizing the incident, the response actions taken, and key learnings for future prevention.
